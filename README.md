# Basketball Scraper

The goal of this project is to set-up a basketball (NBA) database and fill it with data.
To go about this we implement include a few layers:
- DB Setup
    - Used to setup and manage the database 
- Data Collection Layer
    - Logic for pulling the data from an external data source
- ETL Manager
    - Calls the data collection layer and saves it into the database

## How to Setup?

### Virtual Environment
Create a new virtual environemnt
```
python -m venv venv  # The second parameter is a path to the virtual env.
```

Activate the new virtual environment
```
# Windows
.\venv\Scripts\activate

# Unix
source venv/bin/activate
```

Leaving the virtual environment
```
